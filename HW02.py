Function name: split_pizza
Parameters: number of pizzas (int), number of people (int)
Returns: None (NoneType)
Description: Write a function that takes in the number of pizzas ordered for a
party (int) and the number of people who will attend the party. Each pizza will
have exactly 8 slices and each person who attends the party must eat exactly
the same number slices (each person will eat the maximum amount of slices that
they can eat). Given this information, determine how many pieces of pizza each
person will eat at the party and how many pieces will be remaining at the end
of the party. Print out this information in the following format: "Each person
will eat (slices) slices with (remaining slices) slice(s) left over."

Function name: how_many_pets
Parameters: dollars (int)
Returns: statement on pets user can buy (string)
Description: Write a function that takes in the amount of dollars available to
the user (as an integer). Next, calculate the amount of pets the user can buy,
given this amount of dollars. It costs $5 to buy a dog, $2 to buy a cat, and $1
to buy a bird. The user will buy as many dogs as possible, followed by as many
cats as possible, and will spend any left over money on buying birds. Return a
string informing the user about the amount of pets the user can buy in the
following format: "$(dollars) will buy you (dogs) dog(s), (cats) cat(s), and

Function name: create_username
Parameters: name (str), animal (str), year (str)
Returns: username (str)
Description: Write a function that takes in a name as a string, an animal type
as a string, and a year as a string. Your job is to use these parameters to
create a username. The animal type will be the first element of the username,
the year will be the second element of the username, and the name will be the
third element of the username. Every element of the username should be
separated from the other elements by a dash ("-"). At the end of your function,
return the username (string) that you have created.

have already written to find the volume of a sphere with a radius equal to the
one that was passed in. Call the function cube to find the volume of a cube with
side lengths equal to the one that was passed in. Then compute the difference
between these two volumes (volume of the sphere minus volume of the cube). At

Function name: museum_tours
Parameters: no parameters
Returns: closing time (str)
Description: A museum has hired you to make a function that calculates the time
the museum will close for the day. The closing time for the museum is depednent
upon the number of tours that will take place that day and how long the average
tour is. Ask the user how many tours will take place in a day and how long the
average tour is (in minutes). Given this information, return a string
representation of the tours end time (which will be the museum's closing time)
in the following format: "__:___".  You may assume that tours start at 1:00 pm
and will not go later than 11:59 pm. You may also assume that the user will
only enter in integer values for number of tours and tour duration.

Note: Acceptable formatted return times include: "4:55", "9:00", "3:02".
Unacceptable formatted return times include: "04:55", "9: ", and "3:2". String
formatting will be helpful in making sure that your return time is formatted
correctly!
